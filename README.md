# ROCK-PAPER-AND-SCISSOR-GAME

## Description

This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game implemented in Java. The user can play against the computer in a series of five rounds. The user's choice and the computer's choice are randomly generated, and the winner of each round is determined based on the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors rules. At the end of the series, the overall winner is declared based on the number of wins for each player.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository or download the `Project_02.java` file.
2. Compile the Java code using a Java compiler of your choice.
3. Run the compiled Java program in your terminal or command prompt.
4. The program will prompt you to enter a number to represent your choice:
   - Enter 1 for Rock
   - Enter 2 for Paper
   - Enter 3 for Scissors
5. After each round, the program will display the user's and computer's choices, as well as the result of the round (Win, Loss, or No Result).
6. The game continues for five rounds.
7. At the end of the series, the overall winner (user or computer) will be declared based on the number of wins.
